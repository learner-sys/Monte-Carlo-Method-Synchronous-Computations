# Synchronous Computations

We have a metal plate of size 400*400. A constant heat of 100 degrees is applied on each of the sides of the plate. The initial temperature of the rest of the plate is 40 degrees. Write a program that simulates the change in temperature in each point of the plate over time. Stop the simulation after 1000 cycles of simulation. The result of your computation is the maximum and minimum temperature in the plate. Partition the matrix based on rows.
## Written a program to solve the problem using openMP with different number of threads (2-8) and different loop scheduling strategies.
