# Monte-Carlo-Method-&-Synchronous-Computations

This project aim to use parallel computation methods.
</br> The Monte Carlo Method is used to estimate the value of pi by estimating the number of darts hitting a circle with a radius of 1 unit. The program is then used to solve a problem with a number of tosses = 100,000, with different number of processes (2- 8 processes).
</br> The  Synchronous Computations, A metal plate with 100 degrees of heat applied on each side has a 40-degree initial temperature. A program simulates temperature changes over 1000 cycles, partitioning the matrix based on rows. The program uses openMP with different threads  (2-8) and different loop scheduling strategies.
